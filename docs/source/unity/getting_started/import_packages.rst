Importing the required packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To enable data collection in Unity, you will need to import the following packages.

If you already have the OculusUtilities for Unity installed (these include ``OVRPlayerController``, for instance):

	* Download the ``DATA COLLECTION PACKAGE`` from ``HERE`` and import_ it into Unity 
	
If you haven't installed the OculusUtilities for Unity, you have two options:

If you intend to use the latest version of the OculusUtilities for Unity

	* Download and extract  |OculusUtilitiesPackage|__ (this is in the Engine Integration section of the linked webpage) and then import_ ``OculusUtilities.unitypackage`` into Unity.

__ https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/

	* Download the ``DATA COLLECTION PACKAGE`` from ``HERE`` and import_ it into Unity 
	
OR, if you intend to use the version of the OculusUtilities that was originally used when implementing the platform (for example if the above doesn't work)

	* Download the ``DATA COLLECTION PACKAGE WITH OCULUSUTILITIES (SHOULD BE 1.3.2)`` from ``HERE`` and import_ it into Unity.

After having imported either data collection package, you will find several new folders in your Project Explorer, including:

	- CommunicationWIF
	- OVR
	- Plugins
	- Recorder
	- Sample Scene
	- Time
