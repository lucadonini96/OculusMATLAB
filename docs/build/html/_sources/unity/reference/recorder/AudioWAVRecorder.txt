AudioWAVRecorder
++++++++++++++++
The ``AudioWAVRecorder`` script records the audio perceived by the player (``AudioListener``).

If the ``Record WAV`` checkbox is enabled, the audio will be saved to a ``.wav`` file.

If the ``Record TXT`` checkbox is enabled, the audio data will be saved to a ``.txt`` file. Please refer to ``DOCUMENTATION!!!`` for more information.

**NOTE:** This script has known issues and does not record *all* sounds being played. Please test the script on your project and see if it works for you.
